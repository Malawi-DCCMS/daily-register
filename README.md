# 🌤️ Daily Register App

A mobile-first, offline-first app built using the Community Health Toolkit to streamline the collection, coding, and dissemination of weather observations. The Daily Register App simplifies data entry, automates observation coding, and shares coded observations securely to the Global Telecommunication System (GTS).


## 💡 Problem Statement

Weather assistants currently face challenges with manual data collection and coding of observations. Meteorologists then manually verify and submit these observations, resulting in increased workload and potential inaccuracies.
